# FACTURINO v1 ‚Äî ROADMAP 5  
_Pre-Pilot Hardening & Partner-Bureau Trial_  
**Created 2025-07-26**

We are feature-complete on paper, but a partner bureau needs a **fully localised UI, real PSD2 sandbox runs, accountant console, and a proved e-faktura upload** before they will touch production.  
This roadmap closes those last gaps.

---

## Exec conventions (reminder to Claude)

* **Patch this roadmap first**, commit, then start coding.  
* Each micro-ticket touches *max two* files, ‚â§ 500 LOC new code, end files with `// LLM-CHECKPOINT`.  
* Add a **mini-audit** under `### Audit: <ID>` after each DONE row:  
  ```markdown
  ### Audit: UI-L10n-01  
  ‚úÖ Extracted 47 hardcoded strings to mk.json, UI now 95% Macedonian.  
  ‚ö† Remember to test language switching in browser.  
  ```
* All PHPUnit / Cypress tests run inside the app or frontend container.
* No new Composer / npm packages unless ticket explicitly states so.
* Keep dependency whitelist intact; if a new lib is truly required open NX-ticket first.
