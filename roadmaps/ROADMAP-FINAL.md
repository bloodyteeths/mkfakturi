## CPAY Implementation Notes for Future Claude

### What Was Implemented (CPAY-01 & CPAY-02)
1. **CpayDriver.php** already existed in `Modules/Mk/Services/` with complete implementation:
   - Full payment processing with charge() and refund() methods
   - Macedonia-specific features (VAT rates, bank codes, phone formatting)
   - Robust error handling and validation
   - Direct environment variable access for compatibility

2. **PaymentService.php** already had CPAY integration:
   - Instantiates CpayDriver in constructor
   - Routes MKD currency payments automatically to CPAY
   - Handles payment callbacks with signature verification
   - Updates invoice status after successful payments

3. **Comprehensive Tests** already in place:
   - Unit test: `tests/Unit/CpayCompatTest.php` (467 lines)
   - Feature test: `tests/Feature/CpayGatewayTest.php` (554 lines)
   - Full end-to-end coverage including error scenarios

### Key Technical Details
- CPAY URL: https://cpay.com.mk/payment (test mode available)
- Signature: SHA256 hash of sorted data fields + secret key
- Supported banks: Stopanska (250), Komercijalna (260), TTK (270), NLB (300)
- Payment limits: 0.01 - 999,999.99 MKD
- VAT rates: 18% standard, 5% reduced

### Configuration Required
Add to `.env`:
```
CPAY_MERCHANT_ID=your_merchant_id
CPAY_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
CPAY_PAYMENT_URL=https://cpay.com.mk/payment
CPAY_SUCCESS_URL=/payment/success
CPAY_CANCEL_URL=/payment/cancel
CPAY_CALLBACK_URL=/payment/callback
```

php artisan test --filter CpayGatewayTest
php artisan test --filter CpayCompatTest
```

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Success Factors
- **FIX section must complete first** - resolves audit blockers
- **Sample data enables realistic demos** - essential for bureau confidence
- **AI assistant provides competitive edge** - unique market differentiator
- **Sales materials enable business growth** - professional bureau outreach

### Technical Dependencies
- Docker MCP service requires Node.js 18+ and Python 3.9+
- UBL schemas must be downloaded from official sources
- Paddle webhooks need sandbox/production environment configuration
- CPAY integration requires Macedonia banking sandbox credentials

### Business Impact
- **Pre-FIX**: 85% technical platform with gaps
- **Post-FIX**: 100% functional core platform
- **Post-Sample Data**: Demo-ready for bureau engagement
- **Post-AI**: Market-leading competitive advantage
- **Post-Sales Materials**: Business development ready
