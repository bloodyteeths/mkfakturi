# ROADMAP-L10N â€“ Branding & Full UI Localisation  
Created 2025-08-30

## Conventions
* â‰¤ 2 files per ticket, â‰¤ 500 LOC per new file, end file with `// LLM-CHECKPOINT`.
* After each DONE ticket add a mini-audit block, e.g.

```markdown
### Audit : BR-01  
âœ… "InvoiceShelf" â†’ "Facturino" replaced in 17 Blade files.
```

    â€¢    No new composer/npm packages unless a ticket explicitly names them.
    â€¢    All artisan / vite commands run inside containers.

|------|------------|--------|
| G-A Scan | SCAN-01 âœ… | any BR-* tickets |
| G-B Strings | INT-01 & INT-02 âœ… | UI-* tickets |
| G-C Human QA | INT-01â€¦03 âœ… | UI-* tickets |

- Use existing Vue i18n setup, don't add new packages
- Run artisan/vite commands inside Docker containers
