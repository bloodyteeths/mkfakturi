## Project Workflow Memories
- Before starting each roadmap, check repos in roadmap, if there is any ready code you can download from repo list. Now continue with the next step
- First audit what you did before each time you are marking roadmap as done
- Add personal notes about what you did during the task
- Check on next steps for future work
- IMPORTANT: Before starting ANY task, READ THE ENTIRE ROADMAP FILE thoroughly
- Perform a comprehensive review of the task details before beginning work
