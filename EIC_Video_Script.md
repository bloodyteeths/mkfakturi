## SCRIPT

### Opening (0:00 - 0:20)

*[Look directly at camera, speak naturally]*

"Hi, I'm [Your Name], founder of Facturino.

I'm going to tell you about the biggest gap in European financial infrastructure — and how we're filling it.

There are 18 million people in the Western Balkans. 710,000 businesses. And they have **zero** modern financial infrastructure."

---

### The Problem (0:20 - 0:50)

"In America, if you want to build a fintech app, you use Plaid for bank data and Stripe for payments. In Western Europe, same thing — Tink, Stripe, Adyen.

In the Balkans? **Nothing.**

Banks don't talk to each other. There's no open banking. Developers cannot build. Cross-border payments take five days and cost 5%.

I'm from Macedonia. I've lived this problem. Every business owner I know wastes hours on manual bookkeeping because there's no way to connect their bank account to any software.

This isn't just inconvenient. It's holding back an entire region."

---

### Why Now (0:50 - 1:15)

"Here's what's changing.

All six Balkan countries are EU candidates. They will join the European Union in the next 5 to 10 years. And when they do, they need financial infrastructure that works.

PSD2 — the open banking regulation — is coming. Banks will be **forced** to open their APIs.

But someone needs to aggregate them. Someone needs to build the platform that makes this data usable.

Plaid won't do it — the market is too small for them. Stripe won't do it — it's too complex.

That's our opportunity. **First mover takes all.**"

---

### What We've Built (1:15 - 1:45)

"We didn't just write a business plan. We built the product.

Today, Facturino is connected to three Macedonian banks — NLB, Stopanska, Komercijalna. These are the largest banks in the country.

We have a working API. Real-time transaction sync. AI that understands Macedonian invoices and tax law.

We built e-invoice infrastructure that's Peppol-ready for EU integration.

This is not a prototype. This is production infrastructure. And we're launching publicly in Q1 2026.

We've proven it works. Now we need to scale."

---

### The Vision (1:45 - 2:15)

"Our vision is simple:

When a Macedonian startup needs to verify a bank account — they use Facturino.

When a Serbian fintech wants to build a lending app — they build on Facturino.

When an Albanian business sends an invoice — payment happens through Facturino.

We're not building an app. We're building the **financial nervous system** for an entire region.

And when the EU welcomes 18 million new citizens — the infrastructure will already be there.

This is a winner-take-all market. There is no second place in infrastructure."

---

### The Ask (2:15 - 2:45)

"We're requesting EUR 17.5 million from the EIC Accelerator.

EUR 2.5 million in grant for innovation — to connect 25 more banks and build world-class API infrastructure.

EUR 15 million in equity for scale — to expand into Serbia, Kosovo, and Albania, and build full payment capabilities.

With this funding, we will dominate four countries, connect 100,000 businesses, and reach EUR 25 million in annual revenue within three years.

The path to a billion-euro valuation is clear."

---

### Closing (2:45 - 3:00)

*[Slight pause, then direct to camera]*

"The Balkans don't need another accounting app.

They need infrastructure.

We're building it.

Thank you."

*[End]*

## PRODUCTION NOTES

**Do:**
- Speak naturally, like you're explaining to a friend
- Look at the camera (eye contact)
- Use simple language, no jargon
- Show confidence but not arrogance
- One take is fine — authenticity matters more than polish

**Don't:**
- Read from a teleprompter word-for-word (sounds robotic)
- Use fancy editing or graphics
- Make it feel like a commercial
- Go over 3 minutes (they will stop watching)

**Equipment needed:**
- Smartphone with good camera (iPhone is fine)
- Good lighting (face a window, or use a ring light)
- Quiet room
- Simple background (plain wall, office, bookshelf)

**Optional:**
- Add subtitles (helpful for non-native English evaluators)
- Show the product briefly on screen (5-10 seconds max)
