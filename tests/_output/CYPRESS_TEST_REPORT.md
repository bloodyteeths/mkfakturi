## Technical Solutions Implemented

### 1. Docker Timeout Resolution
**Problem:** `cypress/included:latest` taking 2+ minutes to download
**Solution:** 
- Used specific version tag `cypress/included:13.6.0`
- Created fallback configuration with Node.js base image
- Optimized Docker compose configuration

### 2. ES Module Compatibility  
**Problem:** ES import syntax not supported in Docker environment
**Solution:**
- Created `cypress.config.docker.js` with CommonJS syntax
- Updated Docker volumes to use compatible config file

### 3. Application Connection
**Problem:** Cypress needed to connect to Facturino app container
**Solution:**
- Updated baseUrl to `http://app:80` for Docker networking
- Configured proper container-to-container communication

## Commands That Work

### Local Cypress Execution
```bash
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/l10n-basic.cy.js" --browser electron --headless
```

### Docker Cypress Execution  
```bash
docker-compose --profile testing run --rm cypress
```

### Alternative Docker Setup
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.cypress-fallback.yml up
```

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. **Complete Installation:** Finish the database setup to enable full application testing
2. **Language Files:** Verify MK/SQ translation files are properly loaded
3. **Branding Consistency:** Ensure "InvoiceShelf" branding is maintained in final builds

### For Further Testing
1. **Post-Installation Tests:** Run complete l10n.cy.js once installation is finished
2. **Translation Verification:** Test actual translated text content
3. **User Flow Testing:** Test complete invoice/customer workflows in each language

## Artifacts Generated

- **Test Video:** `l10n-basic.cy.js.mp4` (full test execution recording)
- **Screenshots:** 14 screenshots documenting test execution
- **Test Reports:** Console output with detailed pass/fail results

## Conclusion

✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**
