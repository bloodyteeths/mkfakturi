Great — AC-11 through AC-17 frontends are complete.

Now switch into **System Integration + Stability Validation Mode**.

Do not generate new features.  
Do not extend UI.  
Do not create new endpoints.  
Focus only on these tasks:

1. Run a full architecture-level validation for AC-08 through AC-18:
   - Multi-tenant boundaries
   - Permission flows
   - Referral and invitation flows
   - Commission chain correctness
   - Console vs admin access rules
   - Entity reassignment logic
   - Data integrity across all pivot/link tables
   - Network graph accuracy

2. Generate a comprehensive **E2E Test Matrix**:
   - Tests for all invitation types
   - Tests for partner-company permissions
   - Tests for commission chain payouts
   - Tests for reassignment and overrides
   - Tests for network graph API responses
   - Tests for super-admin bypassing

3. Generate a **Manual QA Checklist** for human testing:
   - Step-by-step UI testing instructions
   - Expected behaviors
   - Edge cases
   - Failure scenarios

4. Produce a final **File Inventory Report**:
   - Every file created or modified in AC-08 through AC-18
   - Grouped by backend, frontend, route, middleware, services, migrations
   - With short description of purpose

5. Produce a **Merge Readiness Summary**:
   - What to test before merging into main
   - What could break in production
   - Missing optimizations or cleanup
   - Recommended performance improvements
   - Any remaining TODOs

6. Break output into small, token-safe chunks (800–900 tokens).
   After each chunk, continue automatically with the next item until all tasks
   are complete.

Start with the architecture-level validation for the entire AC-08 → AC-18 scope.
Do not ask for approval or next steps. Continue automatically until everything is
delivered.
