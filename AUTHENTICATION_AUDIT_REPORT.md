# Laravel Authentication Failure - Complete Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**System:** Laravel 8.2 on Railway.app
**Issue:** Login fails with "These credentials do not match our records"
**Status:** ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical Bug Found:** Double password hashing in `ResetAdminCommand.php`

The authentication failure is caused by a **double hashing bug** in the `admin:reset` artisan command. The command uses `Hash::make()` to hash the password before assigning it to the User model, but the User model's `setPasswordAttribute()` mutator automatically applies `bcrypt()` again, resulting in a hash of a hash being stored in the database.

**Impact:** Any user created or updated via the `admin:reset` command cannot log in because the stored password hash is double-hashed.

---

## Technical Analysis

### 1. Authentication Flow

The login process follows Laravel's standard authentication flow:

```
User submits credentials
    ↓
POST /login → LoginController::login()
    ↓
AuthenticatesUsers trait (vendor/laravel/ui/auth-backend/AuthenticatesUsers.php)
    ↓
attemptLogin() → Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password])
    ↓
Hashes input password and compares with database hash
    ↓
Returns true/false
```

**Files Involved:**
- `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/app/Http/Controllers/V1/Admin/Auth/LoginController.php` (uses `AuthenticatesUsers` trait)
- `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/vendor/laravel/ui/auth-backend/AuthenticatesUsers.php` (Laravel framework)
- `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/routes/web.php` (Line 34: `Route::post('login', [LoginController::class, 'login'])`)

### 2. Authentication Configuration

**Config File:** `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/config/auth.php`

```php
'defaults' => [
    'guard' => 'web',
    'passwords' => 'users',
],

'guards' => [
    'web' => [
        'driver' => 'session',
        'provider' => 'users',
    ],
],

'providers' => [
    'users' => [
        'driver' => 'eloquent',
        'model' => \App\Models\User::class,
    ],
],
```

✅ No custom authentication guards or providers interfering
✅ Standard Laravel session-based authentication

### 3. The Double Hashing Bug

**Location:** `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/app/Console/Commands/ResetAdminCommand.php`

**Problem Code (Lines 28-32):**
```php
if ($admin) {
    $this->info("Found existing user. Resetting password...");
    $admin->password = Hash::make($password);  // ❌ FIRST HASH
    $admin->save();
    $this->info("Password updated for user: {$admin->email}");
```

**Problem Code (Lines 69-74):**
```php
$admin = User::create([
    'name' => 'Администратор',
    'email' => $email,
    'password' => Hash::make($password),  // ❌ FIRST HASH
    'role' => 'super admin',
]);
```

**The User Model Mutator (Lines 93-98):**
```php
public function setPasswordAttribute($value)
{
    if ($value != null) {
        $this->attributes['password'] = bcrypt($value);  // ❌ SECOND HASH
    }
}
```

**What Happens:**
1. Command calls `Hash::make('your-secure-password')` → `$2y$12$abc123...` (60 chars)
2. This hash is assigned to `$admin->password`
3. The `setPasswordAttribute()` mutator is automatically triggered
4. It calls `bcrypt()` on the **already-hashed** password → `$2y$12$xyz789...`
5. The **double-hashed** value is stored in the database
6. When user tries to log in, Laravel hashes the plain password once and compares it with the double-hashed value
7. They don't match → Login fails

**Proof of Concept:**
```php
$password = 'testpassword';
$hashedOnce = Hash::make($password);                    // $2y$12$abc...
$hashedTwice = bcrypt($hashedOnce);                     // $2y$12$xyz...

Hash::check($password, $hashedOnce);   // ✅ Returns TRUE
Hash::check($password, $hashedTwice);  // ❌ Returns FALSE
Hash::check($hashedOnce, $hashedTwice); // ✅ Returns TRUE (hash of hash)
```

**Test Results:**
```bash
$ php artisan admin:reset --email="test@example.com" --password="testpassword"
# Creates user with double-hashed password

$ php artisan tinker
>>> Auth::attempt(['email' => 'test@example.com', 'password' => 'testpassword'])
=> false  // ❌ LOGIN FAILS

# But creating user WITHOUT Hash::make() works:
>>> $user = User::create(['email' => 'correct@example.com', 'password' => 'testpassword', ...]);
>>> Auth::attempt(['email' => 'correct@example.com', 'password' => 'testpassword'])
=> true  // ✅ LOGIN SUCCEEDS
```

### 4. Railway Startup Script

**File:** `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/railway-start.sh`

**Lines 143-144:**
```bash
echo "Creating/resetting admin user with email: $ADMIN_EMAIL"
php artisan admin:reset --email="$ADMIN_EMAIL" --password="$ADMIN_PASSWORD"
```

This script is executed during Railway deployment and calls the buggy command, which creates an unusable admin account.

### 5. Database Configuration

**Current Environment:** SQLite (local development)
```php
'default' => env('DB_CONNECTION', 'sqlite'),
```

**Railway Environment:** MySQL
- Connection is dynamically configured in `railway-start.sh` from `MYSQL_URL` environment variable
- Database connection is working correctly (not the issue)

### 6. Middleware Analysis

**Checked Middleware:**
- ✅ `InstallationMiddleware.php` - Only redirects if app not installed
- ✅ `ConfigMiddleware.php` - Only configures file disks
- ✅ No email verification requirements
- ✅ No account status fields blocking login

**Middleware on login route:**
```php
Route::post('login', [LoginController::class, 'login']);
// No middleware applied to this route
```

## Root Cause Summary

| Component | Status | Issue |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Authentication Flow | ✅ Working | Standard Laravel auth, no custom logic |
| Auth Configuration | ✅ Working | Correct guards and providers |
| Database Connection | ✅ Working | Successfully connecting and querying |
| User Model | ⚠️ Has Mutator | `setPasswordAttribute()` auto-hashes |
| ResetAdminCommand | ❌ **BROKEN** | **Uses `Hash::make()` before assignment** |
| Login Controller | ✅ Working | Standard Laravel AuthenticatesUsers trait |
| Middleware | ✅ Working | No interference with login process |

**THE BUG:** `ResetAdminCommand` hashes the password with `Hash::make()` before assigning it to the model, but the model's `setPasswordAttribute()` mutator hashes it again with `bcrypt()`, causing a double-hash that prevents authentication.

## Recommendations

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX - Option 1: Remove Hash::make() from Command (RECOMMENDED)

**File:** `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/app/Console/Commands/ResetAdminCommand.php`

**Change Line 30 from:**
```php
$admin->password = Hash::make($password);
```

**To:**
```php
$admin->password = $password;  // Let the model's setPasswordAttribute() handle hashing
```

**Change Lines 72 from:**
```php
'password' => Hash::make($password),
```

**To:**
```php
'password' => $password,  // Let the model's setPasswordAttribute() handle hashing
```

### 🔴 CRITICAL FIX - Option 2: Remove Mutator and Use Hash::make() Everywhere

**File:** `/Users/tamsar/Downloads/mkaccounting/app/Models/User.php`

**Remove lines 93-98 (the setPasswordAttribute method)**

Then ensure all User creation/update code uses `Hash::make()` explicitly.

**⚠️ Not Recommended:** This would require auditing and updating all User creation/update code throughout the entire application.

### ✅ Option 1 is Preferred

Option 1 is the recommended fix because:
1. **Minimal code changes** - Only 2 lines need to be modified
2. **Follows Laravel conventions** - Using model mutators for automatic hashing is a Laravel best practice
3. **Maintains consistency** - Other parts of the codebase likely rely on the mutator
4. **Lower risk** - Doesn't require changes to multiple files

---

## Immediate Action Plan

1. **Fix the ResetAdminCommand.php:**
   - Remove `Hash::make()` calls on lines 30 and 72
   - Assign plain password and let the model mutator handle hashing

2. **Test the fix locally:**
   ```bash
   php artisan admin:reset --email="test@example.com" --password="testpass"
   # Then try logging in - should work
   ```

3. **Reset the Railway deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Deploy the fix
   git add app/Console/Commands/ResetAdminCommand.php
   git commit -m "fix: remove double password hashing in admin:reset command"
   git push origin main

   # Railway will redeploy and run the startup script with fixed command
   ```

4. **Verify on Railway:**
   - Access the login page
   - Use the credentials from `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables
   - Login should succeed

## Additional Findings

### User Model Has Proper Password Verification
```php
// User.php line 107-114
public static function login($request)
{
    $remember = $request->remember;
    $email = $request->email;
    $password = $request->password;

    return \Auth::attempt(['email' => $email, 'password' => $password], $remember);
}
```

This method is correct and working as expected.

### No Email Verification Required
- No `email_verified_at` column checks in authentication
- No verification middleware on login routes
- No account status fields preventing login

### Installation Status is Not Blocking Login
- `InstallationMiddleware` only applies to routes with `install` middleware
- Login route has no middleware restrictions
- Installation status is properly set in Railway startup script

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Verified authentication flow through code inspection
2. ✅ Confirmed double hashing bug with proof-of-concept test
3. ✅ Tested Hash::make() behavior in isolation
4. ✅ Verified Auth::attempt() fails with double-hashed passwords
5. ✅ Verified Auth::attempt() succeeds with single-hashed passwords
6. ✅ Confirmed User model mutator is causing the second hash
7. ✅ Identified exact lines in ResetAdminCommand causing the issue

---

## Conclusion

The authentication system is functioning correctly. The login failure is entirely due to a coding error in the `ResetAdminCommand` where passwords are being hashed twice (once explicitly with `Hash::make()` and once implicitly by the model's `setPasswordAttribute()` mutator).

**Fix:** Remove the explicit `Hash::make()` calls in `ResetAdminCommand.php` and let the model mutator handle all password hashing automatically.

**Estimated Fix Time:** 5 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low (simple one-line changes in a single file)
**Testing Required:** Basic login test after deployment
