**Scan Date**: 2025-07-25  
**Scan Tools**: TruffleHog v3.90.2, detect-secrets v1.5.0

## Executive Summary

✅ **PASSED**: No verified secrets detected in production code  
⚠️ **WARNING**: 579 potential secrets flagged by detect-secrets (mostly false positives)

## TruffleHog Results

```
🐷🔑🐷  TruffleHog. Unearth your secrets. 🐷🔑🐷

Scan Results:
- Chunks scanned: 3,520
- Bytes processed: 63,441,239
- Verified secrets: 0 ✅
- Unverified secrets: 0 ✅
- Scan duration: 1.38 seconds
```

**Assessment**: Clean scan - no verified secrets found in the codebase.

## detect-secrets Results

**Flagged Files with Pattern Analysis**:
- `.dev/docker-compose.*.yml` - Development database passwords (expected)
- `lang/*.json` - Translation files with "password", "secret", "key" in UI text (false positives)
- Various config files - Mostly UI strings, not actual secrets

**Key Findings**:
1. **Development configs**: Contains expected dev passwords (e.g., `invoiceshelf` DB password)
2. **Language files**: UI translation strings trigger keyword detection
3. **No production secrets**: No API keys, tokens, or production credentials found

## Recommendations

### ✅ Immediate (Completed)
- [x] Implement TruffleHog scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Create `.trufflehog-exclude` file for binary exclusions
- [x] Establish secrets baseline with detect-secrets

### 🔄 Next Steps (SEC-03)
- [ ] Review NLB Gateway placeholder URLs for real endpoints
- [ ] Implement git pre-commit hooks for ongoing secret detection
- [ ] Document secrets management workflow for the team

### 📝 Security Best Practices
1. **Environment Variables**: Use Docker secrets for production credentials
2. **Local Development**: Keep dev passwords simple and documented
3. **CI/CD Integration**: TruffleHog runs on every commit
4. **Regular Audits**: Quarterly security scans with updated tools

## Files Created/Modified

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hooks configuration
- `.secrets.baseline` - Baseline for detect-secrets
- `.trufflehog-exclude` - TruffleHog exclusion patterns
- `trufflehog` binary - Local TruffleHog v3.90.2 installation

## Conclusion

The codebase is **secure from a secrets perspective**. The high number of flagged items are primarily:
- Development environment passwords (expected and documented)
- Translation strings containing words like "password" and "secret"
- UI messages and error strings

**No actual production secrets or API keys were found in the repository.**
