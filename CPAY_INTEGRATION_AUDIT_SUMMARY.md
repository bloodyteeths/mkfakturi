## Technical Validation

### ‚úÖ **Payment Request Creation**
```php
// Successfully creates CPAY payment requests for MKD invoices
$result = $paymentService->createInvoicePaymentRequest($invoice, 'cpay');
// Result: Payment record created, CPAY form generated, ready for processing
```

### ‚úÖ **Callback Processing**
```php
// Successfully processes CPAY callbacks and updates invoice status
$result = $paymentService->processPaymentCallback($callbackData, 'cpay');
// Result: Payment completed, invoice marked as PAID, due amount cleared
```

### ‚úÖ **Complete Workflow Verification**
**Before Payment**:
- Invoice Status: UNPAID
- Due Amount: 150,000 (1,500.00 MKD)
- Payment Status: N/A

**After Payment**:
- Invoice Status: PAID
- Due Amount: 0
- Payment Status: COMPLETED
- Transaction ID: TXN-MK-SUCCESS-[unique]

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **The PaymentService is the centerpiece** - enables unified payment processing
2. **CPAY driver integration is seamless** - automatic routing and processing
3. **End-to-end testing validates business value** - complete workflow verification
4. **Macedonia-specific logic is properly implemented** - currency, banks, VAT rates
5. **Database integrity is maintained** - transaction safety and proper indexing

### **Next Steps for Production**
1. **Environment Setup**: Configure real CPAY credentials
2. **Webhook Endpoints**: Set up CPAY callback URLs in production
3. **Testing**: Validate with real Macedonia banking sandbox
4. **Monitoring**: Implement payment failure alerting
5. **Documentation**: Create user guides for accountants
