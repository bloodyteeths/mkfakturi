## How to Onboard Clients

### Recommended Onboarding Process

#### 1. Identify Potential Clients

Look for businesses that:
- Struggle with manual invoicing (Excel, Word)
- Need e-Faktura compliance (B2B invoicing)
- Want banking integration for reconciliation
- Require multi-user access (team collaboration)

#### 2. Schedule a Demo

Offer a **free 15-minute demo** to show key features:
- Quick invoice creation
- E-Faktura signing
- Payment tracking
- PSD2 banking sync

**Demo Script (Template):**

> "Hi [Client Name],
>
> I noticed you're still using [old system] for invoicing. I've been working with Facturino, a Macedonian-localized platform that automates invoicing, e-Faktura, and banking.
>
> Would you like a quick 15-minute demo? I can show you how it saves 5-10 hours per month on admin work.
>
> Let me know a good time!"

#### 3. Send Referral Link

After the demo, send your referral link via email:

> "Thanks for the demo! Here's the signup link to start your 14-day free trial:
>
> **https://app.facturino.mk/signup?ref=YOUR_CODE**
>
> Let me know if you need help setting up!"

#### 4. Assist with Setup

Offer **hands-on support** (value-added service):
- Import customer data from old system
- Configure invoice templates
- Upload QES certificate for e-Faktura
- Connect bank account (PSD2)

**💡 Tip:** Many accountants charge a one-time setup fee (€50-100) in addition to earning commissions.

#### 5. Ongoing Support

Be the **first point of contact** for your clients:
- Answer questions about features
- Troubleshoot issues (e.g., e-Faktura errors)
- Suggest workflows (e.g., recurring invoices)

This builds loyalty and reduces churn (= longer commissions!).

## Commission Structure

### Default Commission Rate

**5% of monthly subscription fees** (recurring)

### Commission Tiers

| Tier | Active Referrals | Commission Rate |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Bronze** | 1-10 clients | 5% |
| **Silver** | 11-25 clients | 7.5% |
| **Gold** | 26-50 clients | 10% |
| **Platinum** | 51+ clients | 15% |

**Example Earnings (Gold Tier, 30 clients):**

| Plan | Clients | Price/Month | Monthly Revenue | Your 10% |
|------|---------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Starter | 10 | €15 | €150 | €15 |
| Professional | 15 | €30 | €450 | €45 |
| Business | 5 | €60 | €300 | €30 |
| **Total** | **30** | - | **€900** | **€90/month** |

**Annual Earnings:** €1,080 (recurring!)

### Commission Lifecycle

**When do I earn commission?**
- You earn commission starting from the client's **first paid invoice** (after free trial)
- Commission continues **as long as the client subscribes**
- If a client cancels and re-subscribes within 90 days, you still earn commission

**What if a client upgrades?**
- You earn commission on the new (higher) subscription price
- Example: Client upgrades from Starter (€15) to Professional (€30) → Your commission doubles

**What if a client downgrades?**
- Commission is based on the current subscription price
- Example: Business (€60) → Professional (€30) → Commission reduces to 5% of €30

**What if a client churns?**
- Commission stops when the client cancels
- You can try to re-engage them and earn commission again if they return

---

## Payout Process

### Payout Schedule

**Monthly payouts** via **bank transfer**, processed on the **15th of each month** for the previous month's commissions.

**Example Timeline:**
- **November 1-30:** You earn €90 in commissions
- **December 15:** You receive €90 payout

### Minimum Payout

€50 cumulative. If your commission is below €50, it rolls over to the next month.

### Payout Method

**Bank Transfer (SEPA/SWIFT):**
- Provide bank account details in **Settings → Payout Info**
- Payouts are free for Macedonian banks
- International transfers may incur fees (deducted from payout)

### Invoice for Payouts

Partners must issue an **invoice to Facturino** for commission payments (for tax purposes).

Invoice Date: December 15, 2025
Description: Affiliate commission - November 2025
Amount: €90.00
VAT: €0 (B2B service)

## Best Practices

### 1. Target the Right Clients

**Ideal Facturino Client Profile:**
- **Size:** 1-50 employees
- **Industry:** Professional services, retail, e-commerce, freelancers
- **Pain Point:** Manual invoicing, e-Faktura compliance, banking reconciliation
- **Tech Savvy:** Comfortable with basic software (no coding required)

**Less Ideal:**
- Enterprise companies (need custom ERP)
- Cash-only businesses (no invoicing)
- Businesses with complex multi-currency needs (coming soon)

### 2. Position Facturino as a Solution, Not a Product

**Instead of:**
> "Facturino is an invoicing app."

**Say:**
> "Facturino automates your entire invoicing workflow—from creation to payment—and integrates with your bank to reconcile transactions automatically. It saves 10 hours per month."

### 3. Leverage Your Expertise

**Add Value Beyond the Referral:**
- Offer a **free accounting audit** and recommend Facturino as part of the solution
- Provide **setup service** (charge separately)
- Train client staff on best practices (recurring invoices, payment tracking)

### 4. Follow Up

**Don't just send the link and disappear!**

**Week 1:** "Did you sign up? Need help?"
**Week 2:** "How's the trial going? Any questions?"
**End of Trial:** "Ready to subscribe? I can help with onboarding."

### 5. Use Case Studies

Share success stories (with client permission):

> "I helped [Client Name] reduce invoice processing time from 2 hours/week to 15 minutes by setting up automated recurring invoices and bank sync. They're saving €200/month on admin costs."

### 6. Co-Market with Facturino

Contact your Partner Success Manager to:
- Co-host webinars (e.g., "E-Faktura Compliance for SMEs")
- Write guest blog posts
- Get featured in Facturino case studies
